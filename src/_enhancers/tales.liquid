<h1>Tales</h1>
<p>Heavily inspired by the awesome people over at react storybook!</p>
<p>Tales is a compomnent library viewer and testing hub for shopify theme componentry.</p>

<p>The way it works is that you can either view snippets based of a massive stub of shop data. or alternately you can define a tale, where by you can pass specific data into a liquid component. These are pivotal for sections, where the data may be user defined.
